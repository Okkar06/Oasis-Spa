/*
 * Function: get_max_duration_from_start_time
 * Purpose : For each possible start time on a given date, determine the maximum 
 *           end time and maximum possible duration (in minutes), ensuring no 
 *           conflicts with other existing appointments for the selected employee(s).
 *
 * Notes:
 *   – Generates candidate 30-minute start slots from 10:00 to 18:30.
 *   – Finds the next conflicting appointment for each slot for the employee(s).
 *   – Excludes slots that overlap with existing appointments.
 *   – Picks the employee (or one of multiple available employees) whose 
 *     next conflict is latest, yielding the longest possible duration.
 *   – p_employee_id = NULL ⇒ checks all active employees.
 *   – p_exclude_appointment_id allows ignoring an existing appointment 
 *     (e.g., when editing).
 *
 * Signature:
 *   get_max_duration_from_start_time(
 *     p_appointment_date DATE,
 *     p_employee_id INT DEFAULT NULL,
 *     p_exclude_appointment_id INT DEFAULT NULL
 *   ) RETURNS TABLE (
 *     start_time TIME,
 *     max_end_time TIME,
 *     max_duration_minutes INT
 *   )
 *
 * Example:
 *   SELECT * FROM get_max_duration_from_start_time('2025-05-08', 14, NULL);
 *   SELECT * FROM get_max_duration_from_start_time('2025-05-08', NULL, 1);
