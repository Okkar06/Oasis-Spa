/*
 * Function: check_restday_conflict
 * Purpose : Determine if an employee’s requested appointment date falls on their scheduled rest day.
 *           Returns a user-friendly warning string if there’s a conflict, or NULL otherwise.
 *
 * Context :
 *   – Used by the front end to warn (but not block unless creating 1 appointment) booking creation when the employee is off.
 *   – Employees remain able to create the appointment despite the warning.
 *
 * Signature:
 *   check_restday_conflict(
 *     p_employee_id      INT,        -- the ID of the employee to check
 *     p_appointment_date DATE        -- the desired appointment date
 *   ) RETURNS TEXT                   -- warning message or NULL
 *
 * Notes:
 *   • EXTRACT(DOW) yields 1=Monday … 7=Sunday.
 *   • We map the numeric DOW back to a weekday name by adding to a base date (2000-01-03 = Monday).
 *   • Timetable entries carry effective_startdate / effective_enddate; an open-ended end date is NULL.
 *   • IMMUTABLE: no side effects, always same output for same inputs.
